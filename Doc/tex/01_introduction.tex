The outbreak of the novel Coronavirus in 2019 changed everyone's daily life. Due to the virus being very contagious, hygiene became a lot more important and social interactions had to be reduced to a minimum. While the precise measures to reduce the spread of the virus differed from country to country, lockdowns were introduced in almost every part of the world. People were not allowed to go outside unless it was essential for their living. Companies were told to let the employees work from home, so they didn't need to leave the house. Clubs, bars and restaurants had to close down because there were no customers anymore. Considering these and many other points, it is apparent that people were not driving around as much as before the pandemic. Rather they were staying at home, thus considerably reducing their transportation emissions. \\
Many scientists saw this as a unique opportunity to research how much of an impact such lockdowns have on air quality. While daily life was put on hold because of the restrictions, the streets of major cities were emptier than ever. Many articles regarding air quality have been published, however not all followed scientific methods and reviewing practices.
